# Hw 10 : rgb_led_controller 

## Overview
In this assignment we were required to use our previoulsy developed pwm_generator.vhd and to create a rgb led contoller. This was done by creating and avelon bus component that instantiates 3 pwm_generators to drive individual pwm to each of the different leads of the rgb LED. Each pwm duty cycle is controllable via a register value and all have have a global pwm period controlled by a register value as well. We were assigned a specific base address for our component mine was:

`base_address = 0x18CBF0`

## Deliverables

### Red 
**Current Limiting Resistor Calculation**

$R = (3.3V - 2V) / 0.02A = 65Ω$
